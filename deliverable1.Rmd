## Introduction  




## About Our Data




## Preparing our Data

Our data file is located within the current directory, and is stored as a .dta file. In order to read this data, we need to use the read_dta() function from the "haven" package. The code to accomplish this is inside the dm.R file, so we will simply load that file. 


```{r results = "hide", message=FALSE}
source("dm.R")
```
